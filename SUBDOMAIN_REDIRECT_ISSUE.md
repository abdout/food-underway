# Subdomain Redirection Issue

## Problem Description
After a user successfully creates a subdomain during the onboarding process, the redirection to the new subdomain's dashboard is not working as expected. The flow should be:

1. User completes subdomain creation
2. Sees a success modal
3. Upon clicking "Go to Dashboard", gets redirected to `{subdomain}.localhost:3000/dashboard`

## Current Behavior
- The success modal appears after subdomain creation
- Clicking "Go to Dashboard" doesn't properly redirect to the new subdomain
- The URL doesn't change to reflect the new subdomain

## Relevant Code Paths

### 1. Subdomain Creation Flow
- **File**: `src/components/onboarding/subdomain/content.tsx`
  - Handles subdomain input validation and submission
  - Calls `handleCompleteSetup` on form submission
  - Shows `CongratsModal` on success

### 2. Redirection Logic
- **File**: `src/components/onboarding/subdomain/content.tsx`
  - `handleNavigateToDashboard` function is responsible for the redirection
  - Uses `window.location.href` to navigate to the new subdomain

### 3. Middleware Handling
- **File**: `src/middleware.ts`
  - Handles subdomain-based routing
  - Should process requests to `{subdomain}.localhost:3000`

## Potential Issues

1. **Subdomain Resolution**
   - Local development might not resolve subdomains of `localhost`
   - May need to modify hosts file or use a tool like `dnsmasq`

2. **Middleware Configuration**
   - The middleware might not be properly handling the subdomain redirection
   - Check if the subdomain is being extracted correctly in the middleware

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - The environment variables for the root domain might not be set correctly
   - Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` and related configs

## Next Steps for Debugging

1. **Verify Subdomain in Browser**
   - Manually navigate to `http://{subdomain}.localhost:3000/dashboard`
   - Check if the page loads correctly

2. **Check Middleware Logs**
   - Add debug logs in `middleware.ts` to track subdomain extraction
   - Verify the subdomain is being detected correctly

3. **Network Inspection**
   - Use browser dev tools to check the network requests
   - Look for failed requests or redirects

4. **Local DNS Configuration**
   - Ensure `localhost` subdomains are resolving correctly
   - Might need to add `127.0.0.1 {subdomain}.localhost` to hosts file

- `src/components/onboarding/subdomain/content.tsx` - Subdomain creation UI
- `src/config/domains.ts` - Domain configuration
- `src/components/platform/dashboard/subdomain.ts` - Subdomain utilities

## Environment Variables
Check these environment variables are set correctly:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=localhost:3000  # For development
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Testing Locally
To test subdomains locally, you might need to:

1. Edit your hosts file (usually at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows):
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.0.1       test.localhost
127.0.0.1       *.localhost
```

2. Restart your development server after making changes

## Known Issues
- Subdomains might not work out of the box in all browsers
- Some browsers might not resolve `*.localhost` domains
- Consider using a tool like `dnsmasq` or `ngrok` for more reliable local development

## Next Steps
1. Verify local DNS resolution for subdomains
2. Add more detailed logging in the middleware
3. Test with a real domain in development if possible
4. Consider using a service like `lvh.me` for local development
