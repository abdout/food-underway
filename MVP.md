- [ ] Arabic RTL and English LTR fully functional

### Business Metrics
- [ ] School creation to operational setup within 10 minutes
- [ ] Teachers return to platform daily for attendance
- [ ] Parents access portal weekly for student updates
- [ ] Billing system processes manual payments successfully
- [ ] ≥60% staff DAU after 30 days (pilot schools)

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] <2% error rate for core user flows
- [ ] Automated backups running and tested
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified by security audit

## Conclusion

The Hogwarts School Management System has strong technical foundations and most core functionality implemented. The primary gap is **internationalization** (Arabic RTL support), which is critical for the Sudan market. With focused effort on the outlined tasks over 6-8 weeks, the system will be production-ready for MVP launch.

The multi-tenant architecture is solid, authentication system is complete, and core educational features (attendance, timetables, announcements) are functional. The remaining work focuses on performance, localization, and production readiness rather than fundamental feature development.
