# Language Configuration Test Results

## Changes Made:

1. **Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)**:
   - Modified `getLocale()` function to always return Arabic (`ar`) as default for new visitors
   - Removed browser language detection (Accept-Language header)
   - Now only checks cookie for user's explicit choice, otherwise returns `ar`

2. **Language Switcher (`src/components/internationalization/language-switcher.tsx`)**:
   - Added `handleLanguageSwitch()` function that sets `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie before navigation
   - Changed from Link components to button/onClick handlers
   - Cookie is set with 1-year expiration to persist user's choice

## Expected Behavior:

1. **New visitors** (no cookie): Should see Arabic (`/ar`) as default
2. **Language switching**: Should persist when navigating between pages
3. **Login page**: Should maintain selected language when navigating to `/login`

## How to Test:

1. Clear browser cookies for localhost:3001
2. Visit http://localhost:3001 - should redirect to `/ar` (Arabic)
3. Switch to English using language switcher
4. Navigate to login page - should stay in English (`/en/login`)
5. Switch back to Arabic - should persist across navigation

## Technical Details:

- Cookie name: `NEXT_LOCALE`
- Cookie settings: `max-age=31536000` (1 year), `path=/`, `samesite=lax`
- Default locale: `ar` (Arabic)
- Supported locales: `ar` (Arabic, RTL), `en` (English, LTR)
