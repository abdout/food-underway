## Internationalization (ar/en, RTL) — Readiness Checklist

Scope: Arabic-first with English; RTL/LTR switching. Docs exist; implementation scaffolding needed.

### Evidence

- Docs: `/docs/internationalization` with recommended `src/lib/i18n/*` helpers and layout wiring.

### Gaps to MVP

- [ ] Implement `src/lib/i18n/config.ts` and `index.ts` per docs
- [ ] Add `messages/ar.json` and `messages/en.json`
- [ ] Wire `lang` and `dir` in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- [ ] Replace hard-coded strings in top flows (auth, attendance, announcements)
- [ ] Snapshot tests for ar/en on key pages

### Decision

- Status: NOT WIRED — Plan to roll after first shipping features
