# Timetable Features

## New Configuration Options

The timetable component now includes two new configuration options that can be accessed through the Settings dialog:

### 1. Show All Subjects
- **Purpose**: When enabled, this option shows all available subjects in the subject selection dropdown, not just the ones currently used in the timetable.

  - Double-click on any timetable cell to edit the subject
  - The subject selector will show all available subjects plus custom input option

### 2. Display Fallback Data
- **Purpose**: When enabled, this option displays fallback timetable data when the main data source is unavailable or incomplete.
- **Benefit**: Ensures the timetable always shows something useful, even during data loading or when the server is unavailable.
- **Usage**:
  - Enable this option in the Settings dialog
  - Fallback data will automatically be used when main data is missing
  - Fallback data includes a complete 5-day schedule with common subjects
