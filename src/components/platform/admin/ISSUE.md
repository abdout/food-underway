## School Admin â€” Backlog and Acceptance Criteria

This backlog tracks the in-tenant Admin area to MVP. Follow shadcn/ui, mirror pattern, Zod validation, and tenant scoping (`schoolId`) in every query/mutation.

  - Acceptance: server pagination/sort/filter; URL-synced; tenant-safe
- [ ] Assign roles (Owner/Admin/Teacher/Student/Parent/Accountant)
  - Server: Zod-validated action; audit optional; `revalidatePath`
  - Acceptance: role updates persist; correct authorization enforced

### 3) School Settings

### 4) Domain Settings
