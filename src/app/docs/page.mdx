## Introduction

**Automate** the boring. At Databayt, we're building a codebase for business automation, one atomic component at a time. Every line of code is open source, every contribution is valued, and every developer may shape the future of how businesses operate.

We sell the origin of all value — we sell **Time**, the currency that drives the world. Reclaim yours and focus on what truly matters by eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and automating processes.

The Repository of **Wonders.** Think of our codebase as a living library where every contribution becomes part of something greater. From atomic components to complete templates, from blocks to micro-services to full automation solutions—we're creating the building blocks that will power tomorrow's businesses.

Follow along as we **figure** this out together. This isn't just about building software; it's about creating a collaborative ecosystem where developers, businesses, and innovators unite to solve real problems. Every contribution you make doesn't just help one project—it becomes part of a growing foundation that serves countless businesses worldwide.

### How We Tackle a Multi-tenant School Management System

- Architecture: shared schema, strict row-level isolation via `schoolId` on every domain model. Server actions enforce tenant scoping.
- Provisioning: each school gets a unique subdomain instantly (e.g., `school.hogwarts.app`). Custom domains are supported via CNAME.
- Roles & Access: Owner, Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Accountant; least privilege by default.
- Observability: structured logs, metrics, and error tracking; daily backups.

### Product Layout

- Public: marketing site, pricing, docs, school landing pages (`school.hogwarts.app`), authentication
- App: dashboards per role, attendance, timetable, announcements, settings, billing
- Admin: platform-wide moderation, domain approvals, plan configurations

### Business Model

- Cloud-based SaaS per school
- Plans: Trial, Basic, Pro (monthly/annual)
- Pricing aligns with Sudan context; manual payment option supported

### Subscriptions & Trials

- Trial starts on school creation with clear countdown
- Upgrade/downgrade at any time; invoices and receipts available
- Grace period for expired payment before suspension

### Domains & Landing Pages

- Unique subdomain per school at signup
- Optional custom domain mapped via CNAME with automated certificates
- Customizable public landing page per school (logo, colors, hero, contact)

### Internal Tools

- School dashboard: enrollment, classes, subjects, users
- Attendance marking and basic reports
- Announcements composer
- Billing center with plan management and history

### Technical Stack & Patterns

- Next.js App Router, Server Components with Server Actions for mutations
- Prisma with Neon (Postgres); every model has `schoolId`
- shadcn/ui for primitives; composition via atoms → templates → blocks → micro → apps
- Mirror-pattern architecture: `app/feature` mirrors `components/feature`
- Standardized files: `actions.ts`, `constants.ts`, `validation.ts`, `types.ts`, `form.tsx`, `content.tsx`

### Operating Cadence

- Weekly releases, daily standups ≤ 10 minutes, async-first
- Docs updated with every notable change; keep decisions visible
