## Introduction

**Automate** the boring. At Databayt, we're building a codebase for business automation, one atomic component at a time. Every line of code is open source, every contribution is valued, and every developer may shape the future of how businesses operate.

We sell the origin of all value — we sell **Time**, the currency that drives the world. Reclaim yours and focus on what truly matters by eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and automating processes.

The Repository of **Wonders.** Think of our codebase as a living library where every contribution becomes part of something greater. From atomic components to complete templates, from blocks to micro-services to full automation solutions—we're creating the building blocks that will power tomorrow's businesses.

Follow along as we **figure** this out together. This isn't just about building software; it's about creating a collaborative ecosystem where developers, businesses, and innovators unite to solve real problems. Every contribution you make doesn't just help one project—it becomes part of a growing foundation that serves countless businesses worldwide.

### Foucs
We’re building a School Management System for Sudan, together, in our spare time. No deadlines—just clear steps and steady progress.

If you can follow a recipe, you can contribute. Start here.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. If Prisma models changed, also run:

```bash
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 2) Learn the map (what lives where)

- Routes live in `src/app/...`
- Components live in `src/components/...`
- Each feature mirrors its route: `app/feature` ↔ `components/feature`
- Standard files per feature: `actions.ts`, `validation.ts`, `types.ts`, `form.tsx`, `content.tsx`

### 3) Make your first change

Pick a very small task (typo fix, minor UI tweak, doc improvement):

1. Create a new branch
2. Make the change
3. Run `pnpm build` to verify
4. Open a PR with a one-line summary and screenshot if UI changed

### 4) Core product in one minute

- Multi-tenant: every record belongs to a school via `schoolId`
- Provisioning: each school gets a subdomain (e.g., `school.hogwarts.app`)
- Roles: Owner, Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Accountant
- First features: attendance, timetable (basic), announcements, settings, billing (manual-friendly)

### 5) Stack (what we use)

- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Prisma + Neon (Postgres)
- Auth.js, Zod, React Hook Form

### 6) Contribute (the loop)

1. Read the issue, ask clarifying questions if needed
2. Ship a small PR (screenshots for UI; note RTL if relevant)
3. Update docs or changelog if it helps others
4. Repeat next week when you have time

### 7) Links you will need

- Requirements: `/docs/requeriments`
- Architecture: `/docs/architecture`
- Stack & Onboarding: `/docs/stack` and `/docs/stack/onboarding`
- Database: `/docs/database`
- Contribute: `/docs/contribute`
- Community: `/docs/community`
- Roadmap & Changelog: `/docs/roadmap`, `/docs/changelog`

### Notes for Sudan context

- Arabic-first (RTL) with English alongside it
- Low bandwidth: keep pages light; avoid large images
- Manual payments: billing supports receipt upload from day one
