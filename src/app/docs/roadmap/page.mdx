## Roadmap

We are a community-driven team working in our spare time. No deadlines—only a clear path and steady progress. We ship when it’s ready, with continuous iteration.

### Phase A — MVP Core (Ship when useful)

- Tenant provisioning: subdomain, trial, plan selection
- Auth + RBAC: Owner, Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Accountant
- Core data: Students, Teachers, Classes, Subjects
- Attendance (daily/period), basic reports
- Timetable (basic), announcements
- Parent read-only portal
- Billing (manual + online-ready), invoices
- I18N (ar/en), RTL support

### Phase B — Fit & Depth (Polish and breadth)

- Exams and simple grading with exports
- Better reports/dashboards per role
- CSV import/export for core entities
- Self-serve custom domain (CNAME) flow
- Bulk actions, activity logs, audit trails
- Performance budgets and caching pass

### Phase C — Scale (Sustainability)

- Integrations: SMS/email providers common in Sudan
- Role-based mobile-first PWA enhancements
- Advanced billing, discount codes, annual plans
- Data retention and archiving

### Operating Principles

- No deadlines; we contribute consistently
- Depth over breadth; quality over quantity
- Document as we go; teach through docs

### Tracking & Reporting

- Changelog in docs when notable progress lands
- Periodic KPI review (community defined): active schools, attendance events, satisfaction signals
- Incident post-mortems documented and shared
