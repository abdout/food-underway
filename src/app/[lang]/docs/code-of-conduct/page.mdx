## Code of Conduct

We are a small, fast-moving team. This code of conduct keeps us focused and respectful while shipping value quickly for schools in Sudan.

### Our Principles

- Respect first: assume positive intent, critique ideas not people
- Users over egos: the school experience is our north star
- Bias to ship: iterate weekly; small, reversible changes
- Ownership: see issues through to resolution
- Transparency: async-first communication, write it down

### Decision-Making

- Propose → discuss → decide → document. Disagree and commit once a decision is made.
- Use lightweight RFCs for changes to data model, auth, routing, or billing.
- Timebox debates. If unresolved, Tech Lead decides and documents rationale.

### Communication

- Prefer issues/PRs over private messages; document decisions
- Keep standups ≤ 10 minutes; focus on blockers and commitments
- Use clear, action-oriented titles and checklists

### Collaboration

- RFC for changes affecting data model, auth, or URL structure
- Write or update docs with every notable change
- Pair when unsure; optimize for learning and speed

### Quality & Security

- No production secrets in code or chats
- Every data access must include `schoolId` where applicable
- Add tests for critical flows; fix broken builds before adding new features

### Work Habits

- Keep PRs small; include context and screenshots/GIFs
- Write or update docs with each meaningful change
- Respect focus time; batch messages; avoid “urgent” without cause

### Conflict Resolution

- Address issues directly and early
- Assume miscommunication before malice; seek clarity
- Escalate to Tech Lead if needed; outcome documented

### Inclusion

- Arabic and English are both welcome; choose clarity over jargon
- Be mindful of timezone and internet constraints in Sudan

### Enforcement

Report concerns to the Tech Lead. Repeated violations lead to removal from the project. We adhere to zero tolerance for harassment and discrimination.
