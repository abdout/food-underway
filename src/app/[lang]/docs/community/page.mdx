## Community

We’re building a shared economy for Sudanese software developers—open source, paid work when available, and fair revenue sharing.

### Principles

- No deadlines; consistent contributions
- Transparency: public backlog, priorities, and changelog
- Fairness: reward sustained impact, maintenance, and reliability
- Inclusion: Arabic and English, accessible UI, offline-tolerant mindset

### How we collaborate

- Async-first: issues, PRs, and docs carry context
- Short discussions; bias for shipping small steps
- Document decisions in the relevant doc page or PR

### Roles (fluid and opt-in)

- Maintainers: keep repos healthy, review PRs
- Contributors: build features, fix bugs, improve docs
- Coordinators: help triage issues and curate roadmap

### Communication

- Issues for work items
- Discussions (when needed) for direction and proposals
- Docs as the source of truth

### Revenue sharing

- Community treasury receives income (subs, services, sponsorships)
- Allocation based on public contribution history and impact
- Periodic payouts; exact formula evolves with the community

### Getting started

- Read `/docs`
- Pick an issue and comment to take it
- Ask for help in the issue if blocked

Together, we ship useful tools for schools and create opportunity for developers.
